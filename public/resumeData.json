    "bio":"Although I've always been interested in coding, it wasn't until graduating college and taking online Python courses that I found my true passion for software. I started with a few Python Coursera courses before developing my first two web apps in React! From there, I developed a true passion for UI and data visualization, and have been hooked ever since. When I'm not working or coding side projects, you can find me either running around the beautiful Wasatch Mountains, climbing or bouldering rock faces (both inside and out), huddled up in a chair reading, or hitting the slopes for some fresh pow.",
